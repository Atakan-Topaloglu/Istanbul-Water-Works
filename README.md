# Water Works Report

In this Power BI dashboard, I wanted to work on a dataset that wasn't extensively studied and stumbled upon IBB's (Istanbul Municipality) Water Works data.

After lots of data cleaning and data wrangling, I transformed data into its current state.

I incorporated drill-down, drill-through functionalities and used custom measures extensively to enable viewers that are particularly interested to engage in the details. 

Please right click the relevant district on the graph in the third page and click drill-down to see details.
